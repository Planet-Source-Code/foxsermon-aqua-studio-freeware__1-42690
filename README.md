### Source Code

I found this freeware when I was trying to get something
good and of course FREE, by the way I tried with DBArtisan, Toad
and another stuff done by Programmers Sr. but I think this tool
Aqua Studio is real good, you can work with Orale, SQL Server,
MySQL. It is done with Java.

I just want to share the resoucer with all you guys, because
I guess there is someone out there who is looking for a Free
good tool.
